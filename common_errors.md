if anyone feels like they're editing the code file but they aren't seeing their changes, here's some things to look for: 
1) make sure you saved your file. (VS will show an asterisk next to the file if it hasn't been saved).
2) 2) Make sure there are no compiler errors. These can happen if you misspell something or forget some punctuation. 
3) make sure game.exe is closed before you compile. You can look for game.exe in the task manager if you're having trouble finding it. The compiler will tell you that it failed to write to game.exe if it's already open
