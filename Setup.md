You will need to download Visual Studio Community Edition 2022. 

Install the C++ workload. You can find instructions on doing this [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170)

When you download the Mosaic game engine you can unzip the directory wherever you like. Then navigate to that directory in the explorer and open the "command_prompt" file. There are a few versions of this file depending on the configuration of Visual Studio, so if one of them doesn't work try opening the others. If it works you should see a window pop up with text that starts with a bunch of asterisks and then says:

Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt
vcvarsall.bat Environment initialized for: 'x64'

If intsead you just see "the system cannot find the path specified" try opening up one of the other command prompts.

This command prompt is going to one of our main interfaces with the game engine.
